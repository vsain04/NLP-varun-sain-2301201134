Spam Email Classifier

Description: Build a classifier that detects whether an email is Spam or Ham (Not Spam).

Steps:
1. Use the SMS Spam Collection dataset (available on UCI ML repo or Kaggle).
2. Preprocess text (lowercasing, removing stopwords, stemming/lemmatization).
3. Convert messages into TF-IDF features.
4. Train Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression model.
5. Evaluate using confusion matrix + ROC curve.

Deliverable:
● Notebook with preprocessing → training → evaluation.
● Graph showing precision/recall comparison.
Product Review Rating Predictor

Description: Predict whether a product review is Positive, Neutral, or Negative (3 classes).

Steps:
1. Use a dataset from Amazon / Flipkart product reviews (Kaggle has several).
2. Preprocess reviews (tokenization, stopword removal).
3. Convert text into TF-IDF or Word2Vec.
4. Train a Logistic Regression / SVM classifier.
5. Evaluate using macro-averaged F1 score.

Deliverable:
● Classification report (3-class).
● Bar chart comparing class-wise accuracy.
